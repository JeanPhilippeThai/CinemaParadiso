# CinemaParadiso - Data analysis project

**Problems**: Small independent cinema are at risk of closing due to competition from larger commercial cinemas and streaming platforms

**Goal**: Help independant cinema to make data-driven decisions to improve its programming, profitability and customer engagement

**Datasets from Kaggle and The Movie DB**: 21k movies statistics, 15k streaming films, 6k cinema box office, 1400 transactions of people purchasing habits in cinema


**Stack**:
- **BigQuery** used for both OLTP and OLAP workloads
- **DBT** for data transformation
- **LookerStudio** for data visualisation
- **Python**, SQL for data manipulation
- **Github** for version control and **Github Actions** for CI/CD

# Project organisation


## Code stucture
The folders of the project are
- dbt_cinemaparadiso: the DBT project connected to BigQuery
- dev: the python project connected to BigQuery
- colab_notebooks: contains all the notebooks from the team members


## Team organisation
We followed an **Agile methodology** throughout the project, working in 5-day sprints. Daily stand-up meetings (dailies) allowed us to stay aligned, quickly address blockers, and adapt our priorities as needed. This approach helped ensure consistent progress and team collaboration.
